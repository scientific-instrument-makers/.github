We are a charitable community of makers and users of scientific instruments who include scientists, engineers, academics and students.

Founded in 1955 the Company became a full Livery in 1963, we were granted a Royal Charter early in 2021 and celebrated this achievement in 2022. The Company follows the pattern of all Liveries by supporting a profession i.e. scientific instrument making and using.

Members today come from a wide range of industries including measurement and control, medical and biomedical, communication electronics and lighting components, as well as research, development and manufacturing. Members also come from a wide range of levels within their specific fields We welcome everyone from those embarking on their chosen careers to those nearing retirement or indeed already retired.

SIM promotes the craft of scientific instrument making and the exchange of ideas and information by members and guests through meetings, visits, lectures and social events. Equally SIM is very much about providing opportunities for members to give something back through encouraging and mentoring other members or engaging with young people through schools and Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) days.
